<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project uses data from the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/about/what-is-HOS.html">Hospital Compare</a> data set that contains information on over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the United States. The goal was to create a tool that would help inform people’s decisions on what hospital to go to based on why they needed to go to the hospital and how far they were able to travel. We used various measures of hospital performance to recommend to users what hospital to go to, changing which ones were used depending on why the user input they were going to a hospital.</p>
<p>You can access the code and wiki pages for the project on Github <a href="https://github.com/Info-370-Winter-2018/group-formation-for-projects-platypus">here.</a></p>
<p>It was created for the INFO 370 Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Washington by Arihan Jalan, Sarthak Turakhia, Kazunori Kasahara, and Adele Miller.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Current limitations with this project limit its ability to provide a definitive recommendation to users, so users of it should not rely solely upon our tool when making a decision. For more information on this, see the <a href="#assumptions-and-limitations-of-analysis">Assumptions and Limitations of Analysis</a> section.</p>

<p>HAI measures provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. The HAI measures show how often patients in a particular hospital contract certain infections during the couse of their medical treatment, when compared to like hospitals. The CDC calculates a Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) which may take into account the type of patient care location, number of patients with an existing infection, laboratory methods, hospital affiliation with a medical school, bed size of the hospital, patient age, and classification of patient health. SIRs are calculated for the hospital, the state, and the nation. Hospitals’ SIRs are compared to the national benchmark to determine if hospitals’ performance on these measures is better than the national benchmark (lower), no different than the national benchmark, or worse than the national benchmark (higher). The HAI measures apply to all patients treated in acute care hospitals, including adult, pediatric, neonatal, Medicare, and non-Medicare patients.</p>

<h3>Filtering hospital by user zipcode and radius (Arihan)</h3>
<p>Users want to find hospitals near themselves; a user in Washington wouldn’t find information about a hospital in California useful, so we needed a way to filter the hospital dataset and only find hospitals closes to the user. We planned an interface where the user would select their zipcode, their unit of distance preference (metric or imperial), and drag a slider correspondingly to adjust the radius within which they wanted this hospital to be.</p>
<p>Our initial thought was to simple add and subtract 10 to the given zipcode and find all corresponding 21 zipcodes, but that was impractical since it didn’t account for the change in zipcode patterns from going to one state to another (if someone is living close to another State’s border, we would be ommiting hospitals in the other state since we aren’t accounting for the change in format; e.g.- 980XX-994XX in WA vs. 900XX-900-961XX in CA); and it wouldn’t scale to zipcodes of varying sizes; we needed something more accurate.</p>
<p>We found an API called zipcodapi which let us pass in a zipcode, unit, and distance and returned a .csv list of corresponding zipcodes and their distance from the original zipcode passed. It was free and had a daily limit of a 1000 queries per day for this tier which was perfect for our small student-created project, so we moved forward with this service.</p>
<p>After getting the csv file containing the zipcode, their distance from our original zipcode, the city in which the zipcode was, and its corresponding state, we used this information to select a subset of our hospital dataset of all the hospitals contained within the given zipcodes. We now had a list of zipcodes within the users passed zipcode and distance!</p>
<p>For a code based example; please refer to the steps below-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Register for zip-code API key from <a href="https://www.zipcodeapi.com/" class="uri">https://www.zipcodeapi.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Specify your zip-code, radius, and unit of search within R (sample below)</p></li>

<div id="geocaching-information-arihan" class="section level3">
<h3>Geocaching information (Arihan)</h3>
<p>The hospital dataset from Medicare contained a general address (road, city, state, zipcode) for each hospital, but didn’t have information on latitudes and longitudes that can be used to plot hospitals on a map. We need to geocode information; adding geocode addresses means giving an address to Google and getting location inforamtion (lat, long, geoAddress) that can be used on a map.</p>
<p>While this can be added using ggmap; we’re only allowed to query the Google Map’s API through ggmaps 50 times a minute, for upto 2500 times a day, which is problematic for our &gt;4000 hospital big dataset. The solution is to get a premium Google Maps API key; whose usage is relatively cheap at $0.50USD/1000 querieis as of March-11-2018; allows us to meet our needs at $1.25 after accounting for the 2500 free searches we get per day. The steps I used to get this geocode information are as follows-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an address column that has as much location information as possible to help you get the most accurate information. We created a column of strings which contained the hospitals name, address, city, and state through-</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>    hospital.df$adress_search &lt;- paste(hospital.df$Hospital.Name, hospital.df$Address, hospital.df$City, hospital.df$State, sep=&quot;, &quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install ggmaps. At the time of writing this, the version of ggmaps available through the CRAN library on R doesn’t allow users to add a premium key. Get an unreleased version of ggmaps (v. 2.7 not available through install.packes on R) through</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>    devtools::install_github(&quot;dkahle/ggmap&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note- If you get errors, update R, RStudio, and install the missing packages it spits out.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Set your Google Maps API key if you’re running it for the whole database; you can get one from the following link and set within R using <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-limits" class="uri">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-limits</a></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>    register_google(key = &quot;key_goes_here&quot;, account_type = &quot;premium&quot;, day_limit = 10000)</code></pre>
<p>Note- set a modest daily limit that meets your budget; bearing in mind that at the time of writing this, each query was counted as three by Google and that it can take upto a second for each query; at an approximate rate of 16 minutes per 1000 queries.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add geocode information to your dataframe; the loop I used was:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>    for(i in 1:nrow(dataframe_name)){
        result &lt;- geocode(dataframe $adrs_col_name[i], output = &quot;latlona&quot;, source = &quot;google&quot;)

        dataframe_name$geoAddress[i] &lt;- as.character(result[3])
    }</code></pre>
<p>Note- the loop will occasionally stop when it cannot find information for an address; I suggest either manually or automatically within the function itself (not documented) print the row for this missing data and add it manually after the function has added it’s data.</p>

<h3>Data Cleaning for Complications and Healthcare Associated Infections Data</h3>
<p>In order to clean this data to add it to our final data table that had a column for each measure we were going to look at, we changed the format of the data so that there was a column for each measure and a row for each hospital. This involved using a for-loop to reshape the data and create the new columns. You can see this work in the <code>infections_complications_aggregation.R</code> file and <code>disease_complications_aggregation.R</code> file. For the complications data, the standard error was calculated and added as a separate column for each measure, so that each hospital had a standard error measure. We were able to do this for the complications data because a mean score was provided in addition to 95% confidence intervals, so using the formula standard error = ((95% upper limit)) - (mean score))/1.96) we were able to calculate a standard error for those measures.</p>

<div id="analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Justification for analysis</li>
<li>Explanation of recommendation + ranking (Adele) (TODO: Standard error)</li>
</ul>
<p>We determined what hospitals to recommend using an analysis system that ranks hospitals based on how well they did in different metrics, depending on what the user input. Those inputs were “Stroke”, “Heart Failure”, “Heart Attack”, “Hip or Knee Replacement”, “Coronary Bypass Artery Surgery”, “Tobacco Use”, “Alcohol Use”, “Other Surgery”, “Mental Illness”, and “Other. Each was associated with at least one other metric we had from the hospital (listed below.)</p>
<p>Firstly, we filtered down to hospitals using <a href="ZipCodeAPI">https://www.zipcodeapi.com/</a> to get hospitals within a user input radius from a zipcode. The intention here was to give the user the ability to choose a hospital that was within a distance they were willing and able to travel. After this step, we used the user’s input of their reason for visit to determine what metrics we had to judge hospitals by were relevant to their reason for visiting.</p>
<p>Each metric had a score for each hospital in our dataset. Since the scores were relative only to each other, as in you could not compare it against a different metric’s score, we decided to rank hospitals for each metric and then combine the ranks. After calculating the ranks for each hospital, we weighted each rank by multiplying it by 1, 1.5 or 2, corresponding to low, medium, and high importance. Higher ranks were preferrable in our model, as we thought it would be more intuitive to explain the value of each rank as having a multiplier, ex. being 2x more heavily weighted or considered than a low factor, instead of being weighted by using division. Then we created one weighted rank that contained the sum of all of the weighted ranks. We used this value to do the final ranking of the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Process in Code</strong> First, make a call to the ZipCodeAPI with the input zipcode, distance, and a “mi” as the distance unit. This returns the hospitals within the distance (radius) from the zipcode. For demonstration purposes, <code>filtered.hospital.data</code> contains data from a call made to the ZipCodeAPI with the zipcode 98105 and a 8 km radius. Output is a small subset of the table to show the format. The full table is not displayed because it has the dimensions 8 x 186.</p>

<p>Next, a general value for the hospital quality is calculated using multiple measures (see “Other” measure for breakdown.)</p>
<p>A weighted column utilizing all of these ranks is added on to the recommendation table as <code>general.hosp.stats</code>.</p>
<p>Based on the hospitals in the range and the input, rank the columns related to the reason for the visit. The output table shows the ranked column, where larger numbers are the higher ranks.</p>
<p>Here, we see that “Stroke” is informed by data on the mortality rate of stroke patients. Reasons for visits are informed by the following measures. The choices where only one measure is available to inform the decision don’t have valuable weights because they can’t be weighted against other factors since they are the only one pertaining to the choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Stroke” - 30 day mortality rate for stroke patients (weighted high)</li>
<li>“Heart Failure” - 30 day mortality rate for heart failure patients (weighted high), payment cost for heart failure patients (medium)</li>
<li>“Heart Attack” - payment cost for heart attack patients (weighted high)</li>
<li>“Hip or Knee Replacement” - payment cost for hip or knee replacement patients (weighted medium), complication rate for hip or knee replacement patients (weighted high)</li>
<li>“Coronary Bypass Artery Surgery” - 30 day mortality rate for coronary bypass artery surgery patients</li>
<li>“Tobacco Use” - TOB prefix measures - tobacco screening in the past 30 days (weighted lowr), tobacco use treatment (counseling and medication) provided or offered during the first three days of hospitalization (weighted medium), tobacco use treatment provided or offered at discharge (weighted medium)</li>
<li>“Alcohol Use” - SUB prefix measures - alcohol use screening during the past 30 days (weighted low), alcohol use treatment (counseling and medication) provided or offered during the first three days of hospitalization (weighted medium)</li>
<li>“Mental Illness” - FUH prefix measures, including 30 and 7 day follow up rate for hospitalized mental illness patients 30 and 7 day follow up rate (medium, low), and patients discharged on multiple antipsychotic medications with appropriate justification (weighted high)</li>
<li>“Other Surgery” - postoperative wound dehiscence, also known as a wound rupture, rate at a hospital (weighted high), aggregate safety measure PSI_90_SAFETY (weighted medium), post-surgery complication rate (weighted high), HAI.X 1-5 (see description above) all weighted high</li>
<li>“Other” - informed by the same measures as the general hospital statistic, the PSI_90_SAFETY measure (weighted low), median time until pain medication given (weighted medium), median time to fibrinolysis (blood clot medication) (weighted medium), median time until electrocardiography (electric impulse measuring) (weighted medium). These measures are meant to give an indication of hospital wait times and overall safety. <em>They are one of the weakest points of this analysis and a more thorough aggregate would be needed to provide a better overall hospital score.</em></li>

<p>Lastly, the weighted ranks are re-ranked so that they can be the numbers 1 through the number of columns there are. Then, programmatically make sentences that explain the hospital’s high position, such as “Ranked 1 in various metrics used to evaluate hospital safety and quality, ranked 3 in death rate for stroke patients.” Next, change the ranks in the <code>weighted.ranks</code> column so that optimal ranks are lower, ex. 1, 2, 3 instead of 20, 19, 18. Lastly, select the relevant columns, arrange them by their weights in ascending order, and format the column names for display.</p>

<div id="assumptions-and-limitations-of-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Assumptions and Limitations of Analysis</h3>
<p>Firstly, there are serious limitations on our analysis that worsen this project’s ability to recommend an optimal hospital for a patient.</p>
<p>While the code and structure exists inform what hospital someone should go to based on their reason for their visit, the underlying data that supports it is not as extensive as we believe necessary to give a definitive recommendation. For example, several inputs are only informed by one or two measures, such as solely payment data for heart failure. We presented to the user in the “reason” column why each hospital was being recommended to be transparent about how much detail there was supporting the recommendation.</p>
<p>Another serious limitation is the inability to provide a standard error measure that encompasses all of the metrics we are making recommendations based on. This issue stems from not all of the data having confidence intervals or standard error measures, as well as the challenge of incorporating standard error into a rank that uses weighted versions of the measures that the standard error is for.</p>
<p>We make the assumption that our aggregate measure of good a hospital will be considered valuable to our users. It’s probably the weakest part of our analysis because it is informed by only a few things that many might consider to be obscure, such as time until screening. Optimally, we would have survey data from patients to incorporate into this measure. There is a survey given to patients at 11 hospitals that asks them about the nurse and doctor communication, cleanliness, quietness, explanations by the doctor, and other details of their experience at the hospital that would have been preferable to use if each hospital did have measurements for all of those questions instead of only 11 of them. We expected to have this data for each hospital when we began our analysis, not realizing that it was only available for a small subset of our 4,000+ hospitals. Nonetheless, we wanted to include a quality measure for the hospital and we thought that using an aggregate patient safety measure, PSI_90_SAFETY, along with other statistics about how quickly patients got their needs met (pain medication, screenings), were decent stand-ins for a more complete measure. A significant part of why this is included is so that it can be a placeholder for a more complete version of this measurement that would draw on more factors.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that this data set only includes Medicare-certified hospitals, which means that many other hospitals in the country that could be much better for the patient are not analyzed whatsoever.</p>
